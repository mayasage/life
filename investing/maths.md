## P/E Ratio

```text
P/E Ratio = how many dollars the market is willing to pay today for $1 of current earnings.  
          = PV of all future earnings / current EPS
```

## Future Value When Average Growth Rate is known

Future Value = Current Value * (Average rate of growth for the next N years) ^ N years

Derivation:

- Let current Value = 1.5
- N = 5 years
- Average growth rate for the next 5 years = 6%

(B) Growth rate during the year (in %) = 6%

| Year | Value at the start of the year (A) | Value at the end of the year (A * B / 100) |
|:----:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|  1   |                1.5                 |                 1.5 * 1.06                 |
|  2   |             1.5 * 1.06             |            (1.5 * 1.06) * 1.06             |
|  3   |           1.5 * (1.06)^2           |           1.5 * (1.06)^2 * 1.06            | 
|  4   |           1.5 * (1.06)^3           |           1.5 * (1.06)^3 * 1.06            | 
|  5   |           1.5 * (1.06)^4           |           1.5 * (1.06)^4 * 1.06            | 

```text
The final Value at the start of the 6th year = 1.5 * (1.06)^5
                                             = Current Value * (Average Growth Rate for the next N years) ^ N years
```
